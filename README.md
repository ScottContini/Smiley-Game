# Smiley-Game

This is a very simple game that demonstrates JavaScript and DOM processing.  To play it, download all files to a folder and the open smiley.html with your favourite web browser.

The game starts with 8 smiley faces moving slowly across your screen.  Click them to stop them moving -- then they frown.  If you click a stopped one by accident, it will move and smile again.  When you stop all smilies, then you can go to the next level: more smilies and faster moving.  This continues indefinitely.
